# About

This is a collection of reinforcement learning agents and problems written for studying the behaviour of agents that use [state aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3341).

The agents it implements are:
 * Q-Learning
 * Value Iteration
 * TD-lambda with responsibility traces
 * [U-Tree](http://web.media.mit.edu%2F~tristan%2FClasses%2FMAS.945%2FPapers%2FContextual%2FMcCallum_Thesis.pdf&usg=AFQjCNEQLBx-fZS-tzIJL0HiTY7gS-rdSQ&sig2=Tb6rtJ8fB-ZLsU0OU8q5wg) (in progress)

The problems implemented are:
 * Randomly generated "aggregatable" MDPs
 * Mountain car

Some I/O and analysis utilities are included.
